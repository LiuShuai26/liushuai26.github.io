I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher specializing in reinforcement learning, Scalable AI systems, and AI-driven simulation systems. My work spans from building high-performance distributed RL frameworks and AI-native game engines to publishing research on humanoid locomotion.

I am also a volunteer contributor to the Hazel Engine, where I support the development of its upcoming machine-learning module.
